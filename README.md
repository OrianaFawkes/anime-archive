# Anime Archive
Anime Search and Bookmark App.

## About
Anime Archive is an anime search and bookmark app that uses [trace.moe API](https://soruly.github.io/trace.moe-api/#/). This application is a rework of my group's Final Academic Project, **ANI SOS**, for our Mobile Programming Course. This project is a reimagination and review of my earlier Flutter project, allowing me to reinforce concepts learned in my mobile development course, and apply new design principles to enhance the user interface.

## Features

**Anime Search**
- Uses `trace.moe API` to trace back the scene where an anime screenshot is taken from.
- Images can either be from a user's Image Gallery or from an Image URL.

**Search Result**
- A successful search displays the anime's title (in kanji and romanji), the timestamp of the matching scene, and the similarity of the result to the image provided.
- A successful search also showcases a video clip of the matching scene from the anime.

**Anime Archive**
- Search results can be bookmarked or *archived* by the users and a notification will appear if the anime has already been archived before.
- Archived anime are displayed in a list with the most recently archived appearing on top.
